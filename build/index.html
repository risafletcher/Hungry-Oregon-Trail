    <h1>Hungry Oregon Trail</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the harrowing "game" of Oregon Trail.
      The government has sent you and your family out into 
      the wild abandon with some food and a wagon with which
      to make the journey across the US. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As you begin your journey, your hopes are high,
      and your bellies full. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uh-oh! You've encountered a river. What do you do?
